# RunCPython.Net
 This WPF using C# .Net  Windows application demonstrates how to run Python scripts in a distributable Windows .net application
 
# If you'd like to contribute to this repository:
 Feel free to write back about any issues that you face. However, the first version of this application is made simple so that the idea is easily
demonstrated.
The current project is using a Visual Studio Solution so it's possible to add a whole new project into the solution (if the project serves the same purpose of this repository.)
Although the classes, functions, and project as well as the embeddable can be made ready to be used with only a click of a button (or request of a function.) A future update that I'm thinking of is to make the project generate the embeddable for the developer. (;
Currently, the Python embeddable that is used is Python3.9 which is the latest and it's uploaded in this project so if there are issues with some of your scripts because of this latest pythion version, please share.
Possible Future updates:
[ ] create a class to check for updates for the Python embeddable
[ ] start migrating other Python projects
[ ] ....
